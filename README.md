# FinalAssignmentIBM

This is a public repository for me to store my IBM Data Scientist Certificate Final Assignments

1. FirstAssignmentIBM.ipynb: Learned to use Jupyter Notebook and its basic features.
2. StockAnalysisDashboard.ipynb: Using Yahoo Finance, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I created a dashboard to view the growth of TSLA and GME stocks and their revenue over the years. I learned to apply yfinance API to extract stock and revenue information from Yahoo Finance.
